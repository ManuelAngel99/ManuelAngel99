### Hi! Nice to meet you 👋


I’m Manuel Ángel Suárez Álvarez, a Machine Learning Engineer and Computer Science enthusiast. I grew up between cows and chickens in a small farming village in Asturias, Spain.

As of now, I am woring on Large Language Model applications at BBVA's AI Factory, as a memeber of the Generative AI Laboratory.
Previously, I worked building software and machine learning tools in the Air Traffic Control industry at [DataBeacon](databeacon.aero).

I’m best reached via email. I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
